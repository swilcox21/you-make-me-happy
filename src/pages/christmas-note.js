            &nbsp; Hi babe, merry christmas!! Can you believe its our second
            one? I know I haven't seemed like myself lately. I've felt a little
            off these days I sort of feel like I'm drifting and I'm not exactly
            sure what I need to be doing a lot of the time right now. Anyways
            I'm just feeling a little lost but the one thing I've been able to
            count on is you. You are my rock. You are my center. You are my
            home. No one ever seen me the way you do or loved me with such
            passion and devotion and I just want to thank you for how patient
            you have been with me this past year. I'm struggling not to let this
            letter come off too negative because today is about celebrating us!
            This truly is the best relationship I've been apart of I truly
            believe we are so blessed. I know it's corny to say but I really
            can't wait to see what this new year together holds for us
